🧠 About Me
I'm Amirhossein Shiri — a detail-oriented and self-driven Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in crafting responsive, accessible, and high-performance web applications using modern stacks like Vue.js, React, Next.js, Django, and Flask.
With a solid background in Python, JavaScript, and C#, I bring a pragmatic and modular approach to development. Whether it's designing intuitive UIs, integrating APIs, optimizing performance, or managing databases — I thrive on solving real-world problems with elegant code.
I'm also deeply committed to continuous learning — currently advancing my English proficiency and exploring the latest trends in web architecture, DevOps, and open-source collaboration.

I believe in writing code that not only works but also clearly communicates intent. Clean, modular, and expressive code is the foundation of great software — and I strive to make every project a reflection of that principle.
